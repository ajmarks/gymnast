"""
More complex page renderer that extracts the text based on the following plan:

1. Each text showing operation is parsed into a TextBlock object:
2. After a TextBlock is created, it is assigned to a TextLine:
   a. TextLines are assigned based on the line matrix and position.
   b. If no line is matched, a new one is created for that text box.
3. After the entire page is parsed, the text is extracted:
   a. The TextBlocks in each line are sorted by left-most edge.
   b. The texts from each of the line's TextBlock are concatenated together
      with spaces added between LeftBlock and RightBlock based on the space
      between the two blocks and the space width in LeftBlock's font.
   c. Lines are sorted vertically based on their midpoints, and concatenated
      together with newlines (TODO: blank lines as appropriate).

Some background on the math.  Transformation matrices are 3x3 invertible
matrices of the form
                                      [ a b 0 ]
        PdfMatrix(a, b, c, d, e, f) = [ c d 0 ].
                                      [ e f 1 ]
Points are represented as element row vectors [x y 1] with matrices acting on
points by right multiplication.  This is equivalent then to treating points as
[x y], and breaking down the matrix into multiplication and addition:
[x' y'] = [x y]*[a b;c d] + [e f].  This also matches what happens with Tm: it
implicitly applies the line matrix transformation and a translation.

Now, the important part:
For the purposes of determining lines, we don't care about scaling factors, so,
ignoring text rotated 90 or -90 degrees, we can uniquely idenitify lines by two
numbers, slope and y intercept, where

Slope = b/a ([1 0]*[a b;c d] = [a b]) and
Intercept = f - b/a*e.

These numbers are then rounded to one decimal place to prevent visually
indistiguishable items from being placed on different lines.  This correction
will probably be made more sophisticated in the future.
