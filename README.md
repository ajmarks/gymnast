# Gymnast: It's not Acrobat

PDF parser written in Python 3 (backport to 2.7 in the works).  This was designed to provide a Pythonic interface to access (and, eventually, write) Adobe PDF files.  Some of attributes have non-Pythonic capitalization, but that is to match the underlying structure of the PDF document (doing otherwise would get very confusing).

##Usage (dev branch)
```python
import requests
from gymnast import PdfDocument, PdfTextRenderer

url = 'http://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf'
r = requests.get(url)
pdf = PdfDocument(r.content).parse()
text = PdfTextRenderer(pdf.Pages[1], fixed_width=True).render()
print(text)
```

####Output:

            1 E-commerce sales are sales of goods and services where  the buyer places an order, or the price and terms  of the sale  are negotiated over an Internet, mobile 
        device (M-commerce), extranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network, electronic mail, or other comparable online system. Payment may or may not be 
        made online.

##TODO (in no particular order)
- **Features and functionality**
  - [x] Rewrite the parser and document class to lazy-load the document based on the xrefs table
  - [x] Complete the base page renderer
  - [ ] Page Rendering
    - [x] Getting the `BaseRenderer` class working
    - [x] Implement a proof of concept extractor that just dumps strings
    - [x] Get a bit fancier, assigning textblocks to lines and such
  - [ ] Handle page numbering more fully
    - [x] Add a method to `PdfDocument` to get a page by number
    - [ ] Add propreties to `PdfPage` for the page number (both as an `int` and a formatted `str` according to `PdfDocument.Root.PageLabels['Nums']`) (first part done on dev branch)
  - [ ] Backport to Python 2.7 (about 80% done or so)
  - [ ] Font stuff
    - [x] Carve the `PdfFont` class into an abstract `PdfBaseFont` and a `PdfType1Font` implementation
      - [x] `PdfFont.__new__` will pick the correct subclass based on the font's Subtype element
      - [x] `PdfBasefFont` class will also have an abstract method for the glyph space to text space transformation
    - [ ] Add subcless for Type3 fonts
    - [x] Add subcless for TrueType fonts
    - [ ] Add subcless for composite fonts
    - [x] Add legacy support for the 14 standard fonts
