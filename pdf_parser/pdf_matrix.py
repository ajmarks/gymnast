"""
Very simple matrix class for PDF transformation matrices.

PDF Transformations are represented as 3x3 real matrices, the last column of
which is always [0, 0, 1]^T.  Besides assignment, they're used in exactly two
ways: either multiplication by another transformation matrix or left 
multiplication by a coordinate row vector [x, y, 1], so using (and thus 
requiring) numpy for this seemed like massive overkill.

In the interests of compatability, we're not going to rely on Python 3.5's 
matrix multiplication operator, though it does support it.
